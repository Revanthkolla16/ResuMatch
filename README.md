# ResuMatch
ResuMatch is a web application that helps employers find the best candidates using AI. Job seekers upload resumes, and the AI extracts key details (skills, degrees, CGPA, etc.). Employers submit job descriptions, and the system assigns a match score to candidates. Employers can shortlist and finalize candidates, with database storage andÂ notifications.
